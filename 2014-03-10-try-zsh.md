Try `zsh`
=========

I've been using `zsh` for a month now as my shell and I like it. Here are some things that have made the switch worth it for me:

- command history across shell sessions. This was the main reason I stopped using `bash`. Bash history is similar to "last closed session wins" where your history file gets overwritten by the last session you closed. In zsh, every session has access to the history of every other session which is handy since I run 10-12 screen sessions and sometimes several remote terminals.

- command completion for commands and sub-commands, including ssh host completion. I've given up on updating my hosts file or `~/.ssh/config` for logging into the hosts I want to log on to since machine names and IPs change so often. This is much simpler for me since I can type ssh `cogtree@ue1a-[TAB]` and see a list of corresponding hosts. Here's how to configure it: http://www.sourceguru.net/ssh-host-completion-zsh-stylee/

- `cdr`. It's a command that lets you jump to your most recently-used directories: http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/User-Contributions.html#Recent-Directories . It's similar to bash's stack functions (`popd`, etc) that can be used for changing directories except I can actually see the stack, among other things:

       
          [process] simbi crawl/process/messaging (master) ? $ cdr 
          1   -- ~/code/solrcloudpy
          2   -- ~/code/solrcloudpy/docs
          3   -- ~/code/cogtree/api
          4   -- ~/code/cogtree
          5   -- ~

I highly recommend installing `oh-my-zsh` if you're using zsh, it has a lot of plugins enabled and configured out-of-the-box: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#setup
